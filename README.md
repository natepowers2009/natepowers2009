Hello!
I go online as Zeglol1234

I have a lot of projects im working on, it just takes a while for me to debug them as I usually only code
in small rushes of energy. I plan on publishing a lot of them soon

My skills are:
- JavaScript
- Bash
- A little bit of C and C++
- The bear minimal of Java and Python
- Chromebook Exploits
- Chrome Extension and App building
- Being an idiot

Some projects I'm working on (note some are not yet public):
- My Website
- UnblindMe - GBB Partition editor for ChromeOS designed to replace some of the blinding white screens
- A DOOM compilation on iSH
- Miner - A cookie clicker mod for adding a mining minigame to the mines
- Polus - A SH1mmer-like kit for recomod
- Remote Controller - A 5 in 1 extension toolkit to make ChromeOS more powerful
- BLANK3R (not to be confused with blank3r) - A chromebook exploit for running code on any url with full API access
