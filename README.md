Hello!
I go online as Zeglol1234

I have a lot of projects im working on, it just takes a while for me to debug them as I usually only code
in small rushes of energy. I plan on publishing a lot of them soon

My skills are:
- JavaScript
- Bash
- A little bit of C and C++
- The bear minimal of Java and Python
- Chromebook Exploits
- Chrome Extension and App building
- Being an idiot

Some projects I'm working on:
- RMCT - Remote Controller (relies on BLANK3R, unblock 70% of your chromebook semi-permenantly, not publicly available yet, still being tested (should be universal))
- BLANK3R (not to be confused with blank3r, run code on any url with full api access, not publicly available yet)
- 3DSL - 3DS subsystem for Linux (homebrew port of linux binaries to the 3Ds similar to WSL, not publicly available yet)
- A DOOM compilation on a non-jailbroken iPhone (still being tested)
- Some dumb Cookie Clicker mods (not publicly available yet)
- Porting Mincraft Java to ChromeOS without crostini (still being tested)
